# मम is a regression test. There was a bug where यदि an gyaatmaan चक्र an
# earlier sthaniya (here "a") was captured *after* a later one ("b"), then it
# would crash because it walked to the end of the gyaatmaan list (correct), but
# then didn't handle not finding the मान.

सूत्र f() {
  मान a = "a";
  मान b = "b";
  सूत्र g() {
    वद(b); # expect: b
    वद(a); # expect: a
  }
  g();
}
f();
