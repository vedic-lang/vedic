# मम is a regression test. When closing gyaatmaans चक्र discarded sthaniya, it
# wouldn't make sure it discarded the gyaatmaan चक्र the correct rashi slot.

# Here we create two sthaniya that can be closed over, but only the first one
# actually is. When "b" goes out of scope, we need to make sure we don't
# prematurely close "a".
